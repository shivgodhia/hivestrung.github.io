Hello! Iâ€™m Shiv Godhia, a Software Engineer [@Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com) where I work on engineering challenges in Machine Learning .

Previously, I studied [Computer Science](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching) [@University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and interned [@Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/alexa) in their Alexa team in Cambridge (UK), [@ScopeNewsLtd](https://scopenews.co.uk/get), [@DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/) and [@A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r).

Here are a few technologies I've worked with.
